# Scrum Definition

Scrum is a lightweight framework[Framework,ExtendScrum] that helps people, teams and organizations[Organization] generate value through adaptive[ScrumPillars,Adaptation] solutions for complex problems.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] to foster an environment where:

1. A Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] orders the work[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] for a complex problem into a Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog].
2. The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] turns a selection of the work[SprintBacklogItem,ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] into an Increment[ScrumArtifacts,Increment] of value during a Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
3. The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] and its stakeholders[Stakeholder] inspect[ScrumPillars,Inspection] the results[Increment] and adjust[ScrumPillars,Adaptation] for the next Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].[ScrumEvent,SprintReview]
4. Repeat[Cadence]

Scrum is simple.
Try it[Scrum] as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals[Commitment,ProductGoal,SprintGoal] and create value.
The Scrum framework[Framework] is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory.[extendScrum]
Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it.
Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships[ScrumTeam] and interactions[ScumEvent].

Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework[Framework].
Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary[Lean,WasteReduction].
Scrum makes visible[ScrumPillars,Transparency] the relative efficacy of current management[Management], environment, and work techniques, so that improvements[ScrumPillars,Adaptation] can be made.

# Scrum Theory

Scrum is founded on empiricism[Empiricism] and lean thinking.
Empiricism[Empiricism] asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed[ScrumPillars,Inspection].
Lean thinking reduces waste[Lean,WasteReduction] and focuses[ScrumValues,Focus] on the essentials.

Scrum employs an iterative[Cadence], incremental[Increment] approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
Scrum engages groups of people[ScrumTeam] who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed[Learn].[SelfManagement]

Scrum combines four formal events[ScrumEvents] for inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection] and adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption], within a containing event[ScrumEvents], the Sprint[ScrumEvents,Sprint].
These events[ScrumEvents] work because they[ScrumEvents] implement the empirical[Empiricism] Scrum pillars[ScrumPillars] of transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency], inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection], and adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption].

## Transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency]

The emergent[Emergence] process and work must be visible[ScrumPillars,Transparency] to those performing the work[ScrumTeam,Developers] as well as those receiving the work[Stakeholder].
With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts[ScrumArtifacts].
Artifacts[ScrumArtifacts] that have low transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
Transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] enables inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection].
Inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection] without transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] is misleading and wasteful.

## Inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection]

The Scrum artifacts[ScrumArtifacts] and the progress toward agreed goals[Commitment,ProductGoal,SprintGoal] must be inspected[ScrumPillars,Inspection] frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.
To help with inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection], Scrum provides cadence[Cadence] in the form of its five events[ScrumEvents].

Inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection] enables adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption].
Inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection] without adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption] is considered pointless[ScrumValues,Courage].
Scrum events[ScrumEvents] are designed to provoke change[ScrumPillars,Adaption].

## Adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption]

If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product[Product] is unacceptable[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone], the process being applied[ScrumEvents] or the materials being produced[ScrumArtifacts] must be adjusted[ScrumPillars,Adaption].
The adjustment[ScrumPillars,Adaption] must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

Adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption] becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered[Management] or self-managing[SelfManagement].
A Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] is expected to adapt[ScrumPillars,Adaption] the moment it learns anything new through inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection].

# Scrum Values[ScrumValues]

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values[ScrumValues]:
**Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage**[ScrumValues]

The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] commits[ScrumValues,Commitment] to achieving its goals[Commitment,ProductGoal,SprintGoal] and to supporting each other.
Their primary focus[ScrumValues,Focus] is on the work of the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] to make the best possible progress toward these goals[Commitment,ProductGoal,SprintGoal].
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] and its stakeholders[Stakeholder] are open[ScrumValues,Openness] about the work and the challenges.
Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] members respect[ScrumValues,Respect] each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected[ScrumValues,Respect] as such by the people with whom they work.
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] members have the courage[ScrumValues,Courage] to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

These values[ScrumValues] give direction to the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] with regard to their work, actions, and behavior.
The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum is used should reinforce these values[ScrumValues], not diminish or undermine them[ScrumValues].[Management]
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] members learn and explore the values[ScrumValues] as they[ScrumTeam] work with the Scrum events[ScrumEvents] and artifacts[ScrumArtifacts].
When these values[ScrumValues] are embodied by the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] and the people they[ExternalPeople] work with, the empirical[Empiricism] Scrum pillars of transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency], inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection], and adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption] come to life building trust.

# Scrum Team[ScrumTeam]

The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team[ScrumTeam] of people, a Scrum Team[ScrumTeam].
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] consists of one Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster], one Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner], and Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers].
Within a Scrum Team[ScrumTeam], there are no sub-teams or hierarchies.
It[ScrumTeam] is a cohesive unit of professionals focused[ScrumValues,Focus] on one objective at a time, the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal].

Scrum Teams[ScrumTeam] are cross-functional[CrossFunctional], meaning the members have all the skills[CrossFunctional] necessary to create value each Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
They[ScrumTeam] are also self-managing[SelfManagement], meaning they[ScrumTeam] internally decide who does what, when, and how.

The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint], typically 10 or fewer people.
In general, we have found that smaller teams[ScrumTeam] communicate better and are more productive.
If Scrum Teams[ScrumTeam] become too large, they[ScrumTeam] should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams[ScrumTeams,ScaledScrum], each focused[ScrumValues,Focus] on the same product.
Therefore, they[ScrumTeam] should share the same Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal], Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog], and Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner].

The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] is responsible[Responsible] for all product-related activities from stakeholder[Stakeholder] collaboration, verification[Learning], maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required.[CrossFunctional]
They[ScrumTeam] are structured and empowered[Management] by the organization[Organization] to manage[Management] their[ScrumTeam] own work.
Working in Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint] at a sustainable pace improves[ScrumPillars,Adaption] the Scrum Team’s[ScrumTeam] focus[ScrumValues,Focus] and consistency[ReduceComplexity].

The entire Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] is accountable[ScrumTeam,Accountable] for creating a valuable, useful Increment[ScrumArtifacts] every Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
Scrum defines three specific accountabilities[Accountable] within the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam]: the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers], the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner], and the Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster].

## Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers]

Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] are the people in the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] that are committed[ScrumValues,Commitment] to creating any aspect of a usable Increment[ScrumArtifacts] each Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].

The specific skills needed by the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] are always accountable[ScrumTeam,Developers,Accountable] for:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint], the Sprint Backlog;[ScrumTeam,Developers,Accountable]
- Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone];[ScrumTeam,Developers,Accountable]
- Adapting[ScrumPillars,Adaption] their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal]; and,[ScrumTeam,Developers,Accountable]
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.[ScrumTeam,Developers,Accountable]

## Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner]

The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] is accountable[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,Accountable] for maximizing the value of the product[Product] resulting from the work of the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam].
How this is done may vary widely across organizations[Organization], Scrum Teams[ScrumTeam], and individuals.

The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] is also accountable[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,Accountable] for effective Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] management, which includes:

- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal];[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,Accountable]
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem];[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,Accountable]
- Ordering Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem]; and,[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,Accountable]
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] is transparent[ScrumPillars,Transparency], visible[ScrumPillars,Transparency] and understood.[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,Accountable]

The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility[ProductOwner,Responsible] to others.
Regardless, the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] remains accountable.[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,Accountable]

For Product Owners[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] to succeed, the entire organization[Organization] must respect[ScrumValues,Respect] their decisions.[Management]
These decisions are visible[ScrumPillars,Transparency] in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog], and through the inspectable[ScrumPillars,Inspection] Increment[ScrumArtifacts] at the Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview].[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner]

The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] is one person, not a committee.
The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] may represent the needs of many stakeholders[Stakeholder] in the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog].
Those wanting to change the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner].

## Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster]

The Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] is accountable[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Accountable] for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.
They[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] and the organization[Organization].

The Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] is accountable[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Accountable] for the Scrum Team’s[ScrumTeam] effectiveness.
They[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] do this by enabling the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] to improve[ScrumPillars,Adaption] its practices, within the Scrum framework[Framework].

Scrum Masters[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] and the larger organization[Organization].

The Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] serves[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve] the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] in several ways, including:

- Coaching the team members[ScrumTeam] in self-management[SelfManagement] and cross-functionality[CrossFunctional];[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Helping the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] focus[ScrumValues,Focus] on creating high-value Increments[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve][ScrumArtifacts] that meet the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone];
- Causing the removal of impediments[Impediments] to the Scrum Team’s[ScrumTeam] progress; and,[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Ensuring that all Scrum events[ScrumEvents] take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox[Timebox].[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]

The Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] serves[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve] the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] in several ways, including:

- Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal] definition and Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] management;[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Helping the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem];[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Helping establish empirical[Empiricism] product[Product] planning for a complex environment[Uncertainty]; and,[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Facilitating stakeholder[Stakeholder] collaboration as requested or needed.[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]

The Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] serves[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve] the organization[Organization] in several ways, including:

- Leading, training, and coaching the organization[Organization] in its Scrum adoption;[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Planning and advising Scrum implementations within the organization[Organization];[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Helping employees and stakeholders[Stakeholder] understand and enact an empirical[Empiricism] approach for complex work; and,[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]
- Removing barriers[Impediments] between stakeholders[Stakeholder] and Scrum Teams[ScrumTeam].[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster,Serve]

# Scrum Events[ScrumEvents]

The Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] is a container for all other events[ScrumEvents].
Each event[ScrumEvents] in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect[ScrumPillars,Inspection] and adapt[ScrumPillars,Adaption] Scrum artifacts[ScrumArtifacts].
These events[ScrumEvents] are specifically designed to enable the transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] required.
Failure to operate any events[ScrumEvents] as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect[ScrumPillars,Inspection] and adapt[ScrumPillars,Adaption].
Events[ScrumEvents] are used in Scrum to create regularity[Cadence] and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum[extendScrum,OtherMeetings].
Optimally, all events[ScrumEvents] are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity[ReduceComplexity].

## The Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint]

Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint] are the heartbeat[Cadence] of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.

They[ScumEvents,Sprint] are fixed length[Timebox] events[ScumEvents,Sprint] of one month[Timebox] or less to create consistency[ReduceComplexity].
A new Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint[ScrumEvents,order,ScumEvents,Sprint].

All the work[PBI] necessary to achieve the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal], including Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning], Daily Scrums[ScumEvents,DailyScrum], Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview], and Sprint Retrospective[ScrumEvents,SprintRetrospective], happen within Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint].

During the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint]:

- No changes[ScrumPillars,Adaption] are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal];
- Quality does not decrease;
- The Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] is refined[ScrumPillars,Adaption] as needed; and,
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated[ScrumPillars,Adaption] with the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] as more is learned.

Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint] enable predictability[Forecast] by ensuring inspection[ScrumPillars,Inspection] and adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption] of progress toward a Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal] at least every calendar month[Timebox].
When a Sprint’s[ScumEvents,Sprint] horizon[Timebox] is too long[Timebox] the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] may become invalid, complexity may rise[ReduceComplexity], and risk may[Uncertainty] increase.
Shorter[Timebox] Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint] can be employed to generate more learning cycles[Cadence] and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame[Timebox].
Each Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] may be considered a short project.

Various practices exist to forecast[Forecast] progress, like burn-downs[ExtendScrum,BurnDown], burn-ups[ExtendScrum,BurnUp], or cumulative flows[extendScrum].
While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism[Empiricism].
In complex environments, what will happen is unknown[Uncertainty].
Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking[Forecast] decision making.

A Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] becomes obsolete.
Only the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] has the authority[ProductOwner,Responsible] to cancel the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].

## Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning]

Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning] initiates[ScrumEvents,Order] the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] by laying out[transparency] the work to be performed for the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
This resulting plan[SprintBacklog] is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team[ScrumTeam,ScumEvents,SprintPlanning,Attendees].

The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] ensures[ProductOwner,Responsible] that attendees[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning,Attendees] are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] and how they[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] map to the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal].
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] may also invite other people to attend[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning,Attendees] Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning] to provide advice.

Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning] addresses the following topics:

**Topic One: Why is this Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] valuable?**

The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] proposes how the product[Product] could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
The whole Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] that communicates why the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] is valuable to stakeholders[Stakeholder].
The Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning].

**Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?**

Through discussion with the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner], the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] select items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] from the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] to include in the current Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] may refine[ProductBacklogRefinement] these items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.

Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] may be challenging.[Forecast]
However, the more the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] know about their[ScrumTeam,Developers] past performance, their[ScrumTeam,Developers] upcoming capacity[Capacity], and their[ScrumTeam,Developers] Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone], the more confident they[ScrumTeam,Developers] will be in their Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] forecasts[Forecast].

**Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done?**

For each selected Product Backlog item[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem], the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] plan the work necessary to create an Increment[ScrumArtifacts] that meets the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone].
This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] into smaller work items[WorkItem] of one day[Timebox] or less.
How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers].
No one else tells[NotTheSameAsGivingAdvice] them[ScrumTeam,Developers] how to turn Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] into Increments[ScrumArtifacts] of value.

The Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal], the Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] selected for the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint], plus the plan for delivering[ScrumArtifacts,Increment] them are together referred to as the Sprint Backlog.

Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning] is timeboxed[Timebox] to a maximum of eight hours[Timebox] for a one-month Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
For shorter Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint], the event is usually shorter.

## Daily Scrum[ScumEvents,DailyScrum]

The purpose of the Daily Scrum[ScumEvents,DailyScrum] is to inspect[ScrumPillars,Inspection] progress toward the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] and adapt[ScrumPillars,Adaption] the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting[ScrumPillars,Adaption] the upcoming planned work.

The Daily Scrum[ScumEvents,DailyScrum] is a 15-minute[Timebox] event for the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers,ScumEvents,DailyScrum,Attendees] of the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam].
To reduce complexity[ReduceComplexity], it is held at the same time and place every working day[ScrumEvents,order] of the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
If the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] or Scrum Master[ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] are actively working on items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem,WorkItem] in the Sprint Backlog, they[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner,ScrumTeam,ScrumMaster] participate[ScumEvents,DailyScrum,Attendees] as Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers].

The Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] want, as long as their Daily Scrum[ScumEvents,DailyScrum] focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
This creates focus[ScrumValue,Focus] and improves[ScrumPillars,Adaption] self-management[SelfManagement].

Daily Scrums[ScumEvents,DailyScrum] improve[ScrumPillars,Adaption] communications, identify impediments[Impediments], promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings[extendScrum,OtherMeetings].

The Daily Scrum[ScumEvents,DailyScrum] is not the only time Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] are allowed to adjust[ScrumPillars,Adaption] their plan.
They[ScrumTeam,Developers] often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting[ScrumPillars,Adaption] or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s[ScumEvents,Sprint] work.

## Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview]

The purpose of the Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview] is to inspect[ScrumPillars,Inspection] the outcome of the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] and determine future adaptations[ScrumPillars,Adaption].
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam,ScumEvents,SprintReview,Attendees] presents the results of their work to key stakeholders[ScumEvents,SprintReview,Attendees,Stakeholder] and progress toward the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal] is discussed.

During the event[ScrumEvents,SprintReview], the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] and stakeholders[Stakeholder] review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview] what was accomplished[Forecast] in the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] and what has changed[ScrumPillars,Adaption] in their environment.
Based on this information, attendees[ScumEvents,SprintReview,Attendees] collaborate on what to do next.
The Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] may also be adjusted[ScrumPillars,Adaption] to meet new opportunities.
The Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview] is a working session and the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] should avoid limiting it to a presentation.

The Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview] is the second to last[ScrumEvents,order] event of the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] and is timeboxed[Timebox] to a maximum of four hours[Timebox] for a one-month Sprint.
For shorter Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint], the event is usually shorter.

## Sprint Retrospective[ScrumEvents,SprintRetrospective]

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective[ScrumEvents,SprintRetrospective] is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam,ScumEvents,SprintRetrospective,Attendees] inspects[ScrumPillars,Inspection] how the last Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone].
Inspected[ScrumPillars,Inspection] elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored.
The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] discusses what went well during the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint], what problems[Impediments] it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved[ScrumValues,Courage].

The Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] identifies[ScrumPillars,Inspection] the most helpful changes to improve[ScrumPillars,Adaption] its effectiveness.
The most impactful improvements[ScrumPillars,Adaption] are addressed as soon as possible.
They[ScrumPillars,Adaption] may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].

The Sprint Retrospective[ScrumEvents,SprintRetrospective] concludes[ScrumEvents,Order] the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
It[ScrumEvents,SprintRetrospective] is timeboxed[Timebox] to a maximum of three hours[Timebox] for a onemonth Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
For shorter Sprints[ScumEvents,Sprint], the event[ScrumEvents,SprintRetrospective] is usually shorter.[Timebox]

# Scrum Artifacts[ScrumArtifacts]

Scrum’s artifacts[ScrumArtifacts] represent work or value.
They[ScrumArtifacts] are designed to maximize transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] of key information.
Thus, everyone inspecting[ScrumPillars,Inspection] them[ScrumArtifacts] has the same basis for adaptation[ScrumPillars,Adaption].

Each artifact[ScrumArtifacts] contains a commitment[ScrumValues,Commitment] to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] and focus[ScrumValues,Focus] against which progress can be measured:[Forecast]

- For the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] it is the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal].
- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal].
- For the Increment[ScrumArtifacts] it is the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone].

These commitments[ScrumValues,Commitment,ProductGoal,SprintGoal,ScrumArtefact,Increment,DefinitionOfDone] exist to reinforce empiricism[Empiricism] and the Scrum values[ScrumValues] for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders[Stakeholder].

## Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog]

The Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] is an emergent[Emergence], ordered list of what is needed to improve[ScrumPillars,Adaption] the product.
It[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam].

Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] that can be Done by the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] within one Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] are deemed ready[Ready] for selection in a Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning] event.
They[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] usually acquire this degree of transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] after refining[ScrumPillars,Adaption] activities.
Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] refinement[ProductBacklogRefinement] is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] into smaller more precise items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem].
This[ProductBacklogRefinement] is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size.
Attributes often vary with the domain of work.

The Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] who will be doing the work are responsible[ScrumTeam,Developers,Responsible] for the sizing.
The Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] may influence the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] by helping them[ScrumTeam,Developers] understand and select trade-offs.

### Commitment[ScrumValues,Commitment]: Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal]

The Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal] describes a future state of the product[Product] which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] to plan against.
The Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal] is in the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog].
The rest of the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] emerges[Emergence] to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal].

> A product[Product] is a vehicle to deliver value.
> It[Product] has a clear boundary, known stakeholders[Stakeholder], well-defined users or customers.
> A product[Product] could be a service, a physical product[Product], or something more abstract.

The Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal] is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam].
They[ScrumTeam] must fulfill (or abandon) one objective[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal] before taking on the next[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal].

## Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] (why), the set of Product Backlog items[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] selected for the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] (what), as well as an actionable plan[WorkItem] for delivering the Increment[ScrumArtifacts,Increment] (how).

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers].
It is a highly visible[ScrumPillars,Transparency], real-time picture of the work that the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] plan to accomplish[Forecast] during the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] in order to achieve the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal].
Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned.
It should have enough detail that they[ScrumTeam,Developers] can inspect[ScrumPillars,Inspection] their progress in the Daily Scrum[ScumEvents,DailyScrum].

### Commitment[ScrumValues,Commitment]: Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal]

The Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] is the single objective for the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
Although the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] is a commitment[ScrumValues,Commitment] by the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers], it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it.
The Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] also creates coherence[Coherence] and focus[ScrumValues,Focus], encouraging the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] to work together rather than on separate initiatives.

The Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] is created during the Sprint Planning[ScumEvents,SprintPlanning] event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.
As the Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] work during the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint], they[ScrumTeam,Developers] keep the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal] in mind.
If the work turns out to be different than they[ScrumTeam,Developers] expected, they[ScrumTeam,Developers] collaborate with the Product Owner[ScrumTeam,ProductOwner] to negotiate[ScrumPillars,Adaption] the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint] without affecting the Sprint Goal[ScrumArtefact,SprintBacklog,Commitment,SprintGoal].

## Increment[ScrumArtifacts]

An Increment[ScrumArtifacts] is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,Commitment,ProductGoal].
Each Increment[ScrumArtifacts] is additive to all prior Increments[ScrumArtifacts] and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments[ScrumArtifacts] work together.
In order to provide value, the Increment[ScrumArtifacts] must be usable.

Multiple Increments[ScrumArtifacts] may be created within a Sprint[ScumEvents,Sprint].
The sum of the Increments[ScrumArtifacts] is presented at the Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview] thus supporting empiricism[Empiricism].
However, an Increment[ScrumArtifacts] may be delivered to stakeholders[Stakeholder] prior to the end of the Sprint.
The Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview] should never be considered a gate to releasing[ScrumArtifacts,Increment] value.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment[ScrumArtifacts] unless it meets the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone].

### Commitment[ScrumValues,Commitment]: Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone]

The Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone] is a formal description of the state of the Increment[ScrumArtifacts] when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

The moment a Product Backlog item[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] meets the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone], an Increment[ScrumArtifacts,Increment] is born.

The Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone] creates transparency[ScrumPillars,Transparency] by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment[ScrumArtifacts].
If a Product Backlog item[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog,ProductBacklogItem] does not meet the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone], it cannot be released[ScrumArtifacts,Increment] or even presented at the Sprint Review[ScrumEvents,SprintReview].[UnfinishedWork]
Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog[ScrumArtefact,ProductBacklog] for future consideration.[UnfinishedWork]

If the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone] for an increment[ScrumArtifacts,Increment] is part of the standards of the organization[Organization], all Scrum Teams[ScrumTeam] must follow it as a minimum.
If it is not an organizational[Organization] standard, the Scrum Team[ScrumTeam] must create a Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone] appropriate for the product[Product].

The Developers[ScrumTeam,Developers] are required to conform to the Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone].
If there are multiple Scrum Teams[ScrumTeams,ScaledScrum] working together on a product[Product], they[ScrumTeam] must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done[ScrumArtefact,Increment,Commitment,DefinitionOfDone].
